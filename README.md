# Worker Threads with NodeJS

The Worker Threads module enables the use of threads that execute JavaScript in parallel. It's useful for performing CPU-intensive JavaScript operations.

## Setup

```bash
yarn
```
or

```bash
npm install
```
### Use

To execute the project, type the following command in the terminal:

```bash

```

or

```bash
npm start
```

The system is now ready to be used via the routes:

**GET** [http://localhost:3000/calculate](http://localhost:3000/calculate)

Just send a empty request for these routes.
